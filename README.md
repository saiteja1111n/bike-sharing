# bike-sharing

This project is done as part of Udacity Deep Learning nano degree program.

This project predicts the bike rental count hourly or daily based on the environmental and seasonal settings.
As part of this project we have implemented forward pass and back propagations instead of using any 3rd party libraries.
We used these implementations to train the model and do predictions.
